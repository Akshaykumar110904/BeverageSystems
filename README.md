# Beverages Cooperation Limited - Inventory & Billing Management System

## Overview
This is a console-based C application developed to manage daily operations of a beverage distribution company. It allows shop registration, stock management, order billing, and inventory refilling. The system uses **binary file storage** (`.dat`) and generates **text-based bills** for persistence and record-keeping.

## Features

- **Brand Management**: Add new beverage brands with price and available stock.
- **Display Stock**: View current inventory with brand ID, name, MRP, and available cases.
- **Order & Billing**: Generate invoices after verifying shop credentials, update stock, and create bill files.
- **Refill Inventory**: Refill stock by entering the brand ID and number of cases.
- **File Handling**: Stores and retrieves data using binary files (`registration.dat`, `stock.dat`) and generates bills as `.txt` files.
